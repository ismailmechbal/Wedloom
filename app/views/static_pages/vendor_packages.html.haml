			Zeroing in on the perfect wedding venue can easily become overwhelming and time consuming, especially if youâ€™re planning in a new city. Pricing and availability are hard to find, and even harder to compare across venues. Once you have a venue chosen, you still need to figure out a caterer, photographer, florist, band, etc..  The list can often seem endless.
